# Overview

This is a project I undertook in order to learn and put Java into practice.
The program itself is rather simple, it contains two classes I created
and its main purpose is to be able to scheduler tasks and see them.

The program works in its current state, but further additions are desirable.
A user interface accompanied by a local save file system is needed for this 
to be considered complete.
